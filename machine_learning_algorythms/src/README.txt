## Machine Learning Toolkit

This toolkit includes Python scripts for performing various machine learning tasks using K-Means clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

### Features

- **K-Means Clustering Visualization**: Visualizes clusters for different feature combinations using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **Elbow Method Visualization**: Determines the optimal number of clusters (k) using the Elbow Method and plots the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) values.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scales the features of the training and test datasets to a range of 0 to 1.
- **KNN Classification**: Implements the KNN algorithm for classification tasks and evaluates its accuracy for different values of k.
- **Feature Combination Analysis**: Analyzes the accuracy of the KNN algorithm for different combinations of features and k values and computes confusion matrices.

### Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `itertools`

### Usage

1. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
2. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
3. Customize the file paths in the script to point to your dataset files.
4. Run the script to perform the desired machine learning tasks.
