# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the distribution and diversity of empirical data in the form of tables and charts using the classic Iris dataset.

## Task

Utilizing the classic Iris dataset, determine:
- The counts of individual species:
  - Counts;
  - Percentage shares.
- Distribution measures for each feature (across all species):
  - Measures of location:
    - Extremes: minimum, maximum;
    - Measures of central tendency: arithmetic mean, median;
    - Measures of higher order locations: lower quartile (Q1), upper quartile (Q3);
  - Measure of distribution diversity: standard deviation (calculated from the sample formula).

Present the results in the form of the following two tables (the first entry in both tables has already been filled in). In Table 1, the percentage shares should be rounded to one decimal place. In Table 2, all numerical values should be rounded to two decimal places.

### Table 1. Counts of Iris Species

| Species   | Count (%)   |
|-----------|------------ |
| setosa    | 50 (33.3%)  |
| versicolor|             |
| virginica |             |
| Total     | 150 (100.0%)|

### Table 2. Characteristics of Iris Features

| Feature                      | Minimum | Mean (± std. dev.) | Median (Q1 - Q3)  | Maximum |
|------------------------------|---------|--------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Sepal Length (cm)            | 4.30    | 5.84 (±0.83)       | 5.80 (5.10 - 6.40)| 7.90    |
| Sepal Width (cm)             |         |                    |                   |         |
| Petal Length (cm)            |         |                    |                   |         |
| Petal Width (cm)             |         |                    |                   |         |

Using the same dataset, create:
- Histogram for each feature (across all species);
- Box plot for each feature (differentiating between individual species).

Present the charts according to the following layout (charts for Sepal Length feature are exemplary and complete).
